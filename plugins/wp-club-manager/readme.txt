== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.2 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Club Manager, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WP Club Manager” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

Automatic updates should work as expected but as always, it is recommended that you backup your site just in case any problems should occur during the update process.
